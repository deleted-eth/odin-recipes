# odin-recipes

This project, the odin-recipes project, is the first proper assignment I have been given from the async, self-paced coding
program named The Odin Project. Upon completion, I will have demonstrated my understanding of certain concepts--such as
creating a git repo with Github and pushing to it, speedily drafting an HTML boilerplate, creating lists and links, and
working from the command line interface.

My goal is to create, with atomic commits, a main index page which have links to a few recipes. It won't be pretty, but it
will be fun. If you've somehow found yourself here, thank you for taking the time to read this.
