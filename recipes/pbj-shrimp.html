<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, I must share a most heinous crime of my own doing. I am not a perfect person. I sometimes have bad thoughts and say mean things,
but I would never hurt anyone. The closest I ever came was December 9th, 2014. My birthday. My friend Tommy gave me some of his older brother's weed
as a gift. Mom, if you're reading this I'm really sorry it was a mistake. When I was clearning my room, I accidentally thought it was candy or something
and ate it without thinking. I immediately knew something was wrong because it tasted awful, but I never want to waste food so I swallowed it. Anyway,
that night I couldn't sleep because my mind was racing and I got really hungry. I promise, it seemed like such a good idea at the time. It was like I
could taste how awesome it was going to be before I even made it. And I was honestly shocked nobody had ever thought of it before, so I felt like I had
to, you know? I am not proud to admit that I finished all of it. Looking back, I can see the error of my ways and I definitely learned my lesson.</p>

<p>This is AI, but it's pretty accurate.</p>
