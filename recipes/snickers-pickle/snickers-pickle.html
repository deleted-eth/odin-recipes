                        <p>The Snickers-pickle, perhaps better known by its street name, the "snickle", is the stuff of a 'Lovecraftian' nightmare. An eldritch horror beyond earthly 
                        comprehension. Last summer, when my family and I visted Egypt, we did a tour of the ancient ruins which was way cooler than last summer's visit to Grandpa Paul
                        in hospice. Anyways, as we were leaving one of the temples I was struck by an etching. At the time I didn't know what to make of it. I've studied my fair share
                        of hieroglyphs and let's just say I'd never seen one like this. Before I was pulled away, I managed to snap a picture. I couldn't find it before typing up this 
                        blog, but trust me it looked just like the photo I included above. The Egyptians must have made contact with some alien force that showed them things from the 
                        future, I can't explain it any other way. If you go to Egypt keep your eye out. I think there's more to them as a society than we're taught in school.</p>
