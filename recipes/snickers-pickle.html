<h1>The Snickle</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The snickers pickle, perhaps better known by its street name, the "snickle", is the stuff a 'Lovecraftian' nightmare. An eldritch horror beyond earthly 
comprehension. Last summer, when my family and I visted Egypt, we did a tour of the ancient ruins which we was cooler than last summer's trip to Grandpa Paul's. 
Anyways, as we were leaving one of the temples I was struck by an etching. At the time I didn't know what to make of it. I've studied my fair share of hieroglyphs
and let's just say I'd never seen one like this. Before I was pulled away, I managed to snap a picture. I couldn't find before typing up this blog, but trust me
it looked just like the photo I included above. A fricking snickle! The Egyptians must have made contact with some alien force that showed them things from the 
future. I can't explain it any other way. If you go to Egypt keep your eye out, I think there's more to them as a society than we know.</p>
