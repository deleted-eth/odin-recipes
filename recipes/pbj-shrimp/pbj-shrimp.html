                        <p>Unfortunately, I must share a most-heinous crime of my own making. I'm not a perfect person. No one is. I sometimes have bad thoughts and say mean things,
                        but I would never hurt anyone. The closest I ever came was December 9th, 2014... my birthday. Mom, if you're reading this, I'm really sorry. It was a stupid
                        mistake. My friend gave me some of his older brother's weed as a gift, which was weird. That night, when I was clearning my room, I had accidentally thought 
                        it was candy or something and ate it without thinking. I immediately knew something was wrong because it tasted awful; but I never want to waste food, so I 
                        swallowed it anyway. That night, I couldn't sleep and I got really hungry. It seemed like such a good idea at the time. It was like I could taste how awesome 
                        it was going to be before I even made it. And I was honestly shocked nobody had ever thought of it before, so I felt like I had to, you know? I am not proud 
                        to admit that I finished all of it. I even enjoyed it. Looking back, I see the error of my ways and I definitely learned my lesson.</p>
