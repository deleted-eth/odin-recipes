<h1>Pineapple Pizza</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The pineapple pizza is perhaps the most notorious of the food crimes. I first encountered the barbeque-laced, sour
circle in high school, sitting around a campfire. Far along the path behind the Murphys' house, on a hard-pat beach shining 
a dull silver in the moonlight, my friend John shared stories of a vile pie in a hushed tone. The wind off the desolate gulf 
coast rattled the empty branches. Despite his obvious embellishments, I remember the cold working its way into my bones. I 
was sick for days after that night. Fifteen years would pass before I could muster the strength to open a can of pineapple
chunks.
